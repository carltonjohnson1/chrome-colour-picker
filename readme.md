This was completed as my final project in a 10 week course I completed on becoming a Front-end Developer. The course was run by [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/students/courses/front-end-web-development-short-course/london).

This project was focused on working on showcasing all the skills I'd learned during the 10 week course, so HTML, CSS and Javascript, without using any frameworks just pure code.

I focused this project on highlighting some of the projects we'd worked on during the 10 weeks as well as displaying some of the skills I'd picked up from other study during the 10 weeks.
